        <h2>Get started</h2>
        <p>Before navigating to the forms you're looking for:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>If you haven't already, contact the Office of Student Academic Services before to ensure you get the best help possible. You can contact them at osas@york.cuny.edu</li>
          <li>Make sure you are logged in. </li>
          <li>Read the 'Tips for Personal Statements' below</li>
          <li>Have your personal statements, transcripts and supporting documents (if applicable) ready.</li>
          <li>Click the button for the appropriate form below.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Students applying for readmission may only do so 4 times, total. The first time will be considered your 'Petition for Readmission'. Any subsequent application will be considered an 'Appeal of Dismissal'. Students are only
            allowed 3 appeals (so a grand total of 4 applications for readmission).</p>
        <p>It is our wish that every student has a readmission application strong enough to warrant readmission. To give yourself the very best odds, we <strong>strongly</strong> recommend  that you contact the Office of Student Academic Services before
            completing an application.</p>
        <p>Email us at osas@york.cuny.edu or fill out a Student Refferal Form and we'll reach out to you.</p>
        <h2>Tips for Personal Statements</h2>
        <p>When considering your petition, your personal statement can make all the difference. When writing your personal statement make sure you accomplish the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clearly explain your situation.</li>
            <li>Sell yourself. Why should we, The Lords, help someone like you.</li>
            <li>What is your plan? A good plan, increases the likelihood of success.</li>
            <li>If possible, try to provide official documentation that supports what you wrote in your personal statement Remember that the committee has to be <em>convinced</em>.</li>
        </ul>
